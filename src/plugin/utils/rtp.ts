 * Here's the problem this class solves: FFmpeg doesn't support multiplexing RTP and RTCP data on a single UDP port (RFC 5761). If it did, we wouldn't need this
 * workaround for HomeKit compatibility, which does multiplex RTP and RTCP over a single UDP port.
 *
 * This class inspects all packets coming in from inputPort and demultiplexes RTP and RTCP traffic to rtpPort and rtcpPort, respectively.
